# Amazon_clone

I created an Amazon clone using HTML and CSS..

Creating a basic Amazon clone using HTML and CSS involves setting up a simple webpage structure with key elements like a header, navigation bar, product listings, and a footer. Below is a step-by-step guide to creating a basic Amazon-like page.

HTML Structure: -Header: Contains the logo, search bar, and navigation links (Sign In, Orders, Cart). -Navigation Bar: Simple links for different categories (Home, Electronics, Books, Fashion, More). -Main Content: Section for product listings, with each product having an image, title, price, and "Add to Cart" button. -Footer: A simple footer with copyright information.

CSS Styling: -Basic reset for margins and paddings. -Styling for the body to set font family and line height. -Header styling to set background color, text color, and layout (flexbox). -Styling for navigation bar and links. -Main content and product item styling to arrange products in a grid-like layout. -Footer styling to fix it at the bottom of the page.
